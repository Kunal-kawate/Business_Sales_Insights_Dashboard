- **Products**: Detailed product information including names and prices.

## Key Features
1. **Total Profit**: Visualizes the total profit generated across all sales.

5. **Category and Product-Level Insights**:
   - Stacked and clustered bar charts for comparing sales across categories, regions, and products.
   - Pie charts for visualizing proportions of sales by product lines or other dimensions.
